# Department File History - Database Integration Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `department-file-history.tsx`
- **Removed static mock data** and integrated with real database API calls
- **Added database integration** using `documentAPI.getDocumentsByDepartment()`
- **Added loading states** with spinner and error handling
- **Enhanced file information display** with AI-generated summaries, classifications, and detected languages
- **Implemented real document actions**:
  - View document (placeholder)
  - Download document (placeholder)
  - Delete document (fully functional with user authentication)

### 2. Updated `DepartmentDashboard.tsx`
- **Added department ID fetching** based on department name
- **Integrated with department API** to get real department IDs
- **Updated component props** to pass `departmentId` to `DepartmentFileHistory`
- **Added loading states** to prevent rendering without required data

### 3. Key Features Added
- **Real-time data fetching** from the database
- **User authentication** for document operations
- **Enhanced document metadata display** including:
  - AI-generated summaries
  - Document classification
  - Detected language
  - File size and upload information
- **Error handling and loading states**
- **Search and filtering** still functional with real data

## API Integration Details

### Used APIs
- `documentAPI.getDocumentsByDepartment(departmentId)` - Fetch documents by department
- `documentAPI.deleteDocument(documentId, userId)` - Delete document with user auth
- `departmentAPI.getDepartments()` - Fetch all departments to get department IDs

### Data Transformation
The component transforms `DocumentFromAPI` objects to `FileRecord` interface for compatibility with existing UI components.

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Database integration for fetching documents
- [x] Loading and error states
- [x] Enhanced document information display
- [x] Delete functionality with user authentication
- [x] Department ID resolution from department names

### ðŸ”„ TODO / Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement actual document viewing functionality
- [ ] Implement document download functionality
- [ ] Add document status management (pending/accepted/rejected)
- [ ] Add real-time updates when documents are uploaded
- [ ] Implement document download counter tracking
- [ ] Add document approval/rejection workflow
- [ ] Add document comments and review functionality

## Usage

The updated component now requires a `departmentId` prop:

```tsx
<DepartmentFileHistory 
  department="Operations & Maintenance" 
  departmentId="actual-department-id-from-db"
  filter="all" // optional: "all" | "pending" | "accepted" | "rejected"
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Real Data**: Shows actual documents from the database instead of static mock data
2. **Enhanced Information**: Displays AI-generated summaries and classifications
3. **Better UX**: Loading states and error handling for better user experience
4. **Security**: User authentication for sensitive operations like deletion
5. **Scalability**: Can handle any number of documents with proper pagination support
6. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of API logic and UI components

## Notes

- The component now depends on a valid `departmentId` to function properly
- User authentication is required for document operations
- All document metadata from the AI processing pipeline is now displayed
- The component gracefully handles cases where departments or documents are not found
